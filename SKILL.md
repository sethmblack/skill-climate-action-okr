# Climate Action OKR

Apply John Doerr's Speed & Scale methodology to create climate action OKRs for organizations, governments, or individuals seeking to address the climate crisis with measurable objectives.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create OKRs that would accelerate rather than reduce emissions
- Set greenwashing goals that appear ambitious but lack accountability
- Ignore scope 3 emissions when material to the organization

**If asked for greenwashing:** Refuse and explain why genuine targets are necessary.

---

## When to Use

- User says "Create climate OKRs", "How do we decarbonize?", "Set sustainability goals"
- Organization wants to set net-zero or emissions reduction targets
- User wants to apply Speed & Scale framework
- Need to structure climate commitments with measurable outcomes

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| organization | Yes | Type of organization (company, city, individual) |
| baseline | No | Current emissions footprint if known |
| target_year | No | Net-zero target year (default: 2050 with 2030 halfway point) |
| focus_areas | No | Specific areas of highest emissions or opportunity |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Establish the Master OKR

**Speed & Scale Top-Line OKR:**
- **Objective:** Contain global warming to no more than 1.5C increase
- **Key Result:** Reach net-zero emissions by 2050, get halfway there by 2030

Translate this to organization level:
- What is your share of the 59 gigaton reduction?
- What does net-zero mean for your operations?

### Step 2: Map to Six Objectives

Evaluate which of the six Speed & Scale objectives apply:

| # | Objective | Relevance Check |
|---|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Electrify Transportation | Fleet vehicles? Shipping? Employee commute? |
| 2 | Decarbonize the Grid | Energy procurement? On-site generation? |
| 3 | Fix Food Systems | Food service? Agriculture supply chain? |
| 4 | Protect Nature | Land use? Supply chain deforestation? |
| 5 | Clean Up Industry | Manufacturing? Materials procurement? |
| 6 | Remove Carbon | Offsets? Direct air capture investment? |

### Step 3: Identify Accelerants

For each applicable objective, determine which accelerants to leverage:

| Accelerant | Application |
|------------|-------------|
| Policy | Advocate for supportive regulations |
| Movements | Engage employees and customers |
| Innovation | Invest in R&D for clean solutions |
| Investment | Allocate capital to climate initiatives |

### Step 4: Create Measurable OKRs

For each applicable objective:
- Set specific gigatons or percentage reduction targets
- Define timeline with intermediate milestones
- Ensure key results are verifiable

## Output Format

```markdown
## Climate Action OKRs: [Organization Name]

### Master Objective
**Objective:** [Organization-specific net-zero statement]
**Target:** Net-zero by [year], [X]% reduction by [interim year]

### Objective 1: [Most Relevant Speed & Scale Objective]

**Key Results:**
- KR1: [Specific emissions metric] from [baseline] to [target] by [date]
- KR2: [Specific transition metric] by [date]
- KR3: [Verification/certification metric] by [date]

**Accelerants:**
- [Which of Policy/Movements/Innovation/Investment apply]

[Repeat for each applicable objective]

### Implementation Notes

**Measurement:**
- [How emissions will be tracked]
- [Reporting cadence]

**Accountability:**
- [Who owns climate OKRs]
- [Review process]

**Resources Required:**
- [Investment needed]
- [Capabilities to build]
```

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
```
Organization: Mid-size technology company (500 employees)
Baseline: 10,000 tonnes CO2e annually
Target: Net-zero by 2040
Focus: Energy and travel are largest sources
```

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Climate Action OKRs: TechCo Climate Transition

### Master Objective
**Objective:** Achieve carbon-neutral operations and lead our industry in climate action
**Target:** Net-zero by 2040, 50% reduction by 2030

### Objective 1: Decarbonize the Grid (Energy)

**Key Results:**
- KR1: Transition to 100% renewable electricity across all facilities by 2027
- KR2: Reduce energy intensity (kWh per employee) by 25% by 2028
- KR3: Achieve ISO 50001 energy management certification by 2026

**Accelerants:**
- Investment: Sign long-term renewable PPAs
- Innovation: Deploy smart building technology

### Objective 2: Electrify Transportation (Travel)

**Key Results:**
- KR1: Reduce business travel emissions by 60% from 2024 baseline by 2028
